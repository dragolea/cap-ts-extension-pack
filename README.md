## `Code Spell Checker`

A basic spell checker that works well with code and documents.

The goal of this spell checker is to help catch common spelling errors while keeping the number of false positives low.

## `Edit csv`

This extensions allows you to edit csv files with an excel like table ui

## `DotENV`

VSCode .env syntax highlighting

## `Rainbow CSV`

Highlight columns in comma (.csv), tab (.tsv), semicolon and pipe - separated files in different colors.
Transform and filter tables using built-in SQL-like query language.
Optional sticky header line.
Provide info about column on hover.
Automatic consistency check for csv files (CSVLint).

## `Indent-Rainbow`

This extension colorizes the indentation in front of your text, alternating four different colors on each step. Some may find it helpful in writing code for Python, Nim, Yaml, and probably even filetypes that are not indentation dependent.

## `TODO HighlightTOD`

Highlight TODO, FIXME and other annotations within your code.

Sometimes you forget to review the TODOs you've added while coding before you publish the code to production. So I've been wanting an extension for a long time that highlights them and reminds me that there are notes or things not done yet.

Hope this extension helps you as well.

## `Path Intellisense`

Visual Studio Code plugin that autocompletes filenames.inte

## `and many more ...`
